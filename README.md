# oVirt &amp; RHEV/Manager drivers for OpenStack
The project is intended to make oVirt &amp; Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager drivers for OpenStack. Currently OpenStack supports libvirt backend without additional features which can be brought by oVirt or RHEV Manager. Ideally the new drivers will make the OpenStack/RHEV-M (or OpenStack/oVirt) bundle some alternative to the OpenStack/vCenter, and increase OpenStack market share.
